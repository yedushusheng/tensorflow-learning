### Medium Article
I wrote a detailed article on Medium on how to calculate the `STFT` of a signal in TensorFlow.
In contains all the math needed and all the code is described step by step.
Link to the article [Audio processing in TensorFlow](https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-processing-in-tensorflow-208f1a4103aa)

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

```
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 TF_audio_process
```

###  Install dependencies
```
pip install tensorflow
```
